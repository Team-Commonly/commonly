/**
 * Layout-invariant guards for v2 CSS rules that regressed in production.
 *
 * These assert the *presence* of specific override rules, NOT computed layout.
 * jsdom has no layout engine — `scrollHeight`, `offsetHeight`, and `overflow`
 * clipping are all 0 / meaningless — so a render test structurally cannot see
 * these bugs. Both invariants below shipped broken and were caught only by a
 * real-browser (MCP Playwright) measurement:
 *
 *   - Your Team card name was flex-crushed to a single char by the category
 *     chip ("AI Citation Strategist" -> "/"). Fixed in #568 — and it had already
 *     silently regressed once via a stale-base revert of the original fix
 *     (d8140397), so a revert is a real, observed failure mode.
 *   - The showcase page clipped ~500px including its footer CTA because it
 *     inherited the `.v2-root` app-shell `overflow:hidden` and never added its
 *     own scroll override (#575).
 *
 * This is a deliberate stand-in until a browser-level layout test tier exists.
 * It precisely guards the thing that actually broke: the override rule going
 * missing. If these assertions feel brittle, that's the point — the rule they
 * pin is load-bearing, and it has been removed by accident before.
