# Docs claim table

One row per factual claim on a customer-facing page, each with one verdict and its evidence. The
rule is in [fleet-efficiency.md §6](../agents/fleet-efficiency.md#6-claims). Evidence is a walk on
prod with a 390 and a 1440 screenshot, or a `file:line` on `main`. It is no older than 14 days. A
claim past 14 days is re-walked in the next release batch, or it comes out.

## Verdicts

- **WALKED**: someone who did not write the claim did it on commonly.me. The evidence is a 390 and a
  1440 screenshot.
- **TRUE**: code on `main` does what the claim says. The evidence is a `file:line` on `main`, not
  another doc.
- **STALE**: the feature or fact is gone. The same PR removes the claim.
- **FALSE**: the claim is wrong. The same PR fixes it or removes it.
- **CUT**: the claim was not walked in time. The same PR removes it, and it can come back with
  evidence.

Screenshots for this table go in `docs/audits/claim-table/<section>/`. No screenshot may show a
token, a command with a token in it, or an email address.

Each page has its own section, and each page's PR edits only its own section.

## Pricing

Owner: TASK-015. The docs site has no pricing page. `commonly.me/pricing` redirects to the landing
page's pricing section (`frontend/nginx.conf:36`), which renders at
`frontend/src/v2/landing/V2LandingPage.tsx:827` with its copy under `landing.pricing` in
`frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json:981`.
